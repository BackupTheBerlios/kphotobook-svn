<strong>We are currently working on a <em>KPhotoBook</em> Handbook. This will take some time though.</strong>
</p>

<p>These are some topics which will be in cluded in the handbook:
</p>
<h2>&#039;Database&#039;</h2>
<p>
A <em>KPhotoBook</em> database is stored as one XML-file. This file contains all source-directories, tags and files belonging to this database. Of course it is possible to have several databases storing different types of photos (e.g. you could have a database for your private photos and a database for your business photos).
</p>
<p>
When a database has changed (tags or source-folders were edited) the file must be saved. That means that changes are not automatically persisted. Each time a file is saved the old file is backed-up.
</p>

<h2>Source Folders</h2>
<p>
A database can contain all images of one or more source folders. Source folders can be added non-recursively or recursively:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>non-recursive</strong>: only the files in the selected folder will be added to the database.</li>
<li><strong>recursive</strong>: all files in the selected folder and all sub-folders will be added to the database.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When adding a folder recursively hard- <strong>and</strong> soft-links are followed by default. To prevent endless-loops <em>KPhotoBook</em> tries to detect and suppress loops in the filesystem directory structure.
</p>
<p>
When restarting <em>KPhotoBook</em> every source folder will be scanned and new found sub-directories and files are addded to the database. This function can also be executed manually. Missed directories or files will not automatically be removed from the database to prevent loss of the association between files and tags.
</p>


<h2>Tags</h2>
<p>
Tags are used to describe what a photo contains or what properties it has. There are different kinds of tags:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>title</strong>: this is a pseudo tag to group other tags together. It cannot be associated with a photo.</li>
<li><strong>boolean</strong>: such a tag is associated with a photo or not.</li>
<li><strong>enumeration</strong>: basically several enumerations are grouped together. <br/>Maximally one of the grouped entries can be selected (e.g. group: Quality contains the enumerations "high", "medium" and "low").</li>
<li><strong>string</strong>: ??? how to describe?</li>
<li><strong>numeric</strong>: ??? how to describe?</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each tag can contain a name and optionally an icon. The tags can be structured hierarchically that means you creat a tree of tags.
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Motiv</strong></li>
        <ul>
        <li>Person</li>
                <ul>
                <li>Family</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                <li>Bob</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                <li>John</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <li>Animal</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <li>Countryside</li>
        </ul>
<li><strong>Quality</strong></li>
        <ul>
        <li>High</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <li>Medium</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <li>Low</li>
        </ul>
</ul>
<p>
When a photo is associated with a tag it is implicitely associated with all parent tags as well. If you have a photo tagged with "Bob" and another photo tagged with "John", searching for photos containing "Persons" will find find these two photos.
</p>

<h2>Photo Manipulation</h2>
<p>
The only yet foreseen manipulation of the photos is rotating them. This can be done in three ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>storing in database</strong>: The rotation information is stored in the database only.</li>
<li><strong>altering EXIF</strong>: The EXIF header of the image is adjusted.</li>
<li><strong>rotating physically</strong>: The image itself is rotated.</li>
</ul>
