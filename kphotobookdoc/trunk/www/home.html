    <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p><em>KPhotoBook</em> is a powerful, easy to use, intuitive and fast application to manage and organize your photos. The main idea is to be able to annotate your photos with tags and to refind the photos using the given tags. The tags which can be created by yourself are arranged in a tree.</p>
        
        <p>The KPhotoBook GUI comes up with several points which makes the handling with many photos very easy. This is just a short excerpt of it's goodies:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>It is very easy to annotate tags to one or more images at a time</li>
        <li>It is very easy to find images by the given tags (actually one mouse click only is needed)</li>
        <li>It is very easy to edit the image database with an external program &ndash; it's saved as XML file</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Please consider having a look at the <a href="handbook.html">handbook</a> for further information.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Basic Features List</h1>
    
        <p><em>KPhotoBook</em> will have at least the following features:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>creating a photo database with photos from several folders which can be added single or recursively</li>
        <li>annotate tags to the photos - this can be done for one photo only or for several photos at once</li>
        <li>the tags are arranged in a tree</li>
        <li>there will be different kind of tags: boolean, string, number</li>
        <li>there can be written a description for each file</li>
        <li>searching and filtering the photos using the given tags and description</li>
        <li>all pictures matching the chosen filter are displayed as thumbnails</li>
        <li>the pictures can be rotated (real, exif or database only)</li>
        <li>showing the exif informations of a selected file</li>
        <li>showing the pictures matching the filter in a slide show</li>
        <li>opening the files with a any desired program</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h1>History</h1>
        <p>The idea for a photo database and photo album program came up during September 2003. Having bought a digital camera few months ago, the necessity for a program to manage all the taken photos became urgent.</p>
        
        <p>At this time, we did not know about a comparable program for KDE. A few weeks later <em>KimDaBa 1.0</em> was released. We looked into this program but decided to go on with the development of <em>KPhotoBook</em> anyway because <em>KimDaBa</em> was not exactlywhat we needed.</p>
        
        <p>In February 2004 a first alpha-version of <em>Fotoon</em> was released. <em>Fotoon</em> came closer to what our idea is... but not exactly. We decided &ndash; once again &ndash; to go on working on KPhotoBook and to have a close eye on these other applications.</p>
        
    <h1>Why another application to manage photos?</h1>
        <p>It's not easy to manage hundreds or even thousands of images. Other applications promote themselves to solve this problem. They say it'd be easy to manage such a huge amount of photos. Having looked at those other applications, we found that it was not <strong>that</strong> easy and not nearly as straight forward as we think such an application should be. Beside this, it is also very important that it is not only easy to manage the photos but also to be fast. Other applications provide the function to tag the pictures but do not offer this function in a real easy and fast way. Some others have the same approach as <em>KPhotoBook</em>, but waiting for an application to become usable when no work is done on it is not really a great thing to do.</p>
