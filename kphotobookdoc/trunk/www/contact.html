<h1>Contacts</h1>

<p>
Currently there are two active developers. Those are supported by two colleagues in questions of program design and user interface. The third supporter is writing and maintaining the home page and the documentation.
</p>

<h2>Mike - Michael Christen</h2>
<p>
<a href="mailto:starcube@users.berlios.de?subject=KPhotoBook"><img alt="contact-icon" align="top" src="pics/contact_m.png" /> Michael</a> is the main developer of <em>KPhotoBook</em>.
</p>
<p>
I was born 1977 in Meyriez (Switzerland). After absolving the elementary school and my apprenticeship in electronics I studied computer science at the School of Engineering and Information Technology in Biel. I've now been working in a rather big telecommunication company and develope java-applications there. Being a Linux and KDE user I now want to give back to the community and also improve my C++ knowledge.<br/>
And... I don't even own a digital camera. ;-)
</p>

<h2>Tom - Thomas Christen</h2>
<p>
<a href="mailto:chtom@users.berlios.de?subject=KPhotoBook"><img alt="contact-icon" align="top" src="pics/contact_m.png" /> Thomas</a> takes care of the <em>KPhotoBook</em> homepage and handbook.
</p>
<p>
Born in 1979 in Meyriez (Switzerland), too. Beeing the little bro of my big brother... After having finished my further education in the security area I am working now. Not having much experience and knowledge with programming, I'm maintaining the homepage and the handbook. My brother always bugs me to maintain the handbook, but he does not understand that I do have a veryyyy loooot of work beside the handbook.... sniff sniff.
</p>

<h2>choenig - Christian Hoenig</h2>
<p>
<a href="mailto:choenig@users.berlios.de?subject=KPhotoBook"><img alt="contact-icon" align="top" src="pics/contact_m.png" /> Christian</a> is a loyal coder of <em>KPhotoBook</em>.
</p>
<p>
I was born in Boeblingen, Germany in 1978. I am currently studying computer science at the technical university in Aachen, Germany. I joined the kphotobook team in March 2005 quite shortly after I found the project on kde-apps.org. I had written my own, not published photo organizer called adimark which has almost the same features as kphotobook. but my codebase is far worse then what Mike did with kphotobook :-). So I mailed him and now I'm part of the Team :-). But ... I do own a digital camera: a Minolta Dimage 7i and I have &gt; 5000 images waiting to be included into my kphotobook ;-).
