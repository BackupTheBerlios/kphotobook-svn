<tr><td class="newstext">I had some problems after updating to <a target="_top" href="http://www.suse.com">SuSE</a> Linux 9.1. KDevelop was no longer usable. So I decided to change to <a target="_top" href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a>. And I must admit, Gentoo is really great. It takes a little bit longer to install the system, but then you can always be up to date with all software...<br/>
There are some more things I must install/configure, but I'll soon continue programming <i>KPhotoBook</i>. I hope to release a new version in the early June 2004.</td></tr>

<td class="newstext">I've just finished a first version containing all basic features (tagging and searching of images). This version is tagged as v_0_0_4.<br/>
The program is still very alpha! The funny thing is, that the application is already rather fast although I did not yet optimize it...<br/>
Please do not yet report wishes for additional features!</td>

A few weeks later KimDaBa was released. However, we decided to go on with development anyway because KimDaBa was not exactly what we needed.</td></tr>
