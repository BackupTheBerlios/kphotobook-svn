<h2>Version 0.0.6</h2>
<p>Released in June 2004.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tagging can be locked/unlocked now to avoid accidental change of tags. The lock can be unlocked temporary by holding the <code>CTRL</code>-key.</li>
  <li>The tree states (open/closed) nodes and the filters are stored.</li>
  <li>It is possible now to export selected/matching images as symbloc links to directory.</li>
  <li>Menu entries for showing/restoring the toolviews. It does not exactly what I did want, but the MDI (Toolview) API is a bit odd. But I think it works well enough.</li>
  <li>Add a quit action which closes all open window and exits KPhotoBook.</li>
  <li>Install a mimetype for KPhotoBook associating '*.kpb' files with KPhotoBook.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.0.5</h2>
<p>Released in April 2004. There are a lot of things to configure now and the GUI is cleaned up.</p>
<ul>
  <li>When setting filters on a parent tags, files associated with the sub tags are considered too. E.g. if dog is a sub tag of animal then, when searching for images containing an animal, the images tagged with dog must be displayed too.</li>
  <li>GUI mode is changeable between IDEAl and TabPage mode.</li>
  <li>Remember the selected files whenever possible (changing filter, changing preview size, ...).</li>
  <li>Set F5 as shortcut for "refresh view" not for "rescan filesystem".</li>
  <li>Ctrl+R as alternate shortcut for "refresh view".</li>
  <li>Use right mouse button on tag filters to cycle backwards through the options.</li>
  <li>The dock configuration is stored now. KDE is really great!</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.0.4</h2>
<p>Version 0.0.4 was released in March 2004. Besides the features of Version 0.0.3, we provided a functional tag tree with title tags and boolean tags, improved filter abilities a few new icons and a new tool bar.</p>

<h2>Version 0.0.3</h2>
<p>Version 0.0.3 was the first release of <em>KPhotoBook</em> and was released in February 2004. It did not provide many features but seemed quite stable already (probably because of the lack of features :-) ). The UI provided a source directory tree and a main window in which thumbnails of the images in the imported directories were shown. There was also a tag tree - it was hard coded at this time. V0.0.3 already had the ability to alter the thumbnail size with a ruler.</p>
