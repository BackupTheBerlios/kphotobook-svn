<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
<em>KPhotoBook</em> is an easy to use, intuitive and fast application to manage and organize your photos. The main idea is to be able to annotate your photos with tags and to refind the photos using the given tags. The tags which can be created by yourself are arranged in a tree.
</p>
<p>
Please consider having a look at the <a href="handbook.html">handbook</a> for further information.
</p>


<h1>History</h1>
<p>
The idea for a photo database and photoalbum program was created during September 2003. We did not know about a compareable program for KDE at this time. A few weeks later <em>KimDaBa</em> was released. However, we decided to go on with development anyway because <em>KimDaBa</em> was not exactly what we needed.
</p>
<p>
In February 2004 a first alpha-version of <em>Fotoon</em> was released. <em>Fotoon</em> comes closer to what our idea is... but not exactly. We will go on working on <em>KPhotoBook</em> and have a close eye on these other applications.
</p>


<h1>Differences to the Existing Projects</h1>
<p>
<em>KimDaBa</em> does not provide a tree for arranging the tags. And in my opinion the user interface is not very intuitive. I believe <em>KPhotoBook</em> has the better approach for an intuitive userinterface. <em>Fotoon</em> uses a similar user interface as I want to implement for <em>KPhotoBook</em>, but the application seems to be very alpha and there wasn't much traffic lately on its cvs. Without wanting to be rude I believe <em>KPhotoBook</em> is more stable than <em>Fotoon</em> and I hope I will make faster progress in implementing it.
