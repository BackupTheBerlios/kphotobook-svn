<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
<em>KPhotoBook</em> is an easy to use, intuitive and fast application to manage and organize your photos. The main idea is to be able to annotate your photos with tags and to refind the photos using the given tags. The tags which can be created by yourself are arranged in a tree.
</p>
<p>
Please consider having a look at the <a href="handbook.html">handbook</a> for further information.
</p>


<h1>History</h1>
<p>
The idea for a photo database and photoalbum program came up during September 2003. We did not know about a comparable program for KDE at this time. A few weeks later <em>KimDaBa</em> was released. However, we decided to go on with development anyway because <em>KimDaBa</em> was not exactly what we needed.
</p>
<p>
In February 2004 a first alpha-version of <em>Fotoon</em> was released. <em>Fotoon</em> comes closer to what our idea is... but not exactly. We will go on working on <em>KPhotoBook</em> and have a close eye on these other applications.
</p>


<h1>Differences to the Existing Projects</h1>
<p>
<em>KimDaBa</em> does not provide a tree for arranging the tags. And in my opinion the user interface is not very intuitive. I believe <em>KPhotoBook</em> has the better approach for an intuitive userinterface. <em>Fotoon</em> uses a similar user interface as I want to implement for <em>KPhotoBook</em>, but the application seems to be very alpha and there wasn't much traffic lately on its cvs. Without wanting to be rude I believe <em>KPhotoBook</em> is more stable than <em>Fotoon</em> and I hope I will make faster progress in implementing it.
</p>

<h1>Features</h1>

<p>
<em>KPhotoBook</em> will have at least the following features:
</p>

<ul>
<li>creating a photo database with photos from several folders which can be added single or recursively</li>
<li>annotate tags to the photos - this can be done for one photo only or for several photos at once</li>
<li>the tags are arranged in a tree</li>
<li>there will be different kind of tags: boolean, string, number</li>
<li>there can be written a description for each file</li>
<li>searching and filtering the photos using the given tags and description</li>
<li>all pictures matching the chosen filter are displayed as thumbnails</li>
<li>the pictures can be rotated (real, exif or database only)</li>
<li>showing the exif informations of a selected file</li>
<li>showing the pictures matching the filter in a slide show</li>
<li>opening the files with a any desired program</li>
</ul>
