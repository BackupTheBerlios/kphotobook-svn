<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
<em>KPhotoBook</em> is a powerful, easy to use, intuitive and fast application to manage and organize your photos. The main idea is to be able to annotate your photos with tags and to refind the photos using the given tags. The tags which can be created by yourself are arranged in a tree.
</P>

<p>The KPhotoBook GUI comes up with several points which makes the handling with many photos very easy. This is just a short excerpt of it's goodies:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is very easy to annotate tags to one or more images at a time</li>
<li>It is very easy to find images by the given tags (actually one mouse click only is needed)</li>
<li>It is very easy to edit the image database with an external program &ndash; it's saved as XML file</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please consider having a look at the <a href="handbook.html">handbook</a> for further information.

<h1>Basic Features List</h1>

<p>
<em>KPhotoBook</em> will have at least the following features:
</p>

<ul>

<li>the tags are arranged in a tree</li>
<li>there will be different kind of tags: boolean, string, number</li>
<li>there can be written a description for each file</li>
<li>searching and filtering the photos using the given tags and description</li>
<li>all pictures matching the chosen filter are displayed as thumbnails</li>
<li>the pictures can be rotated (real, exif or database only)</li>
<li>showing the exif informations of a selected file</li>
<li>showing the pictures matching the filter in a slide show</li>
<li>opening the files with a any desired program</li>
</ul>

<h1>History</h1>
<p>
The idea for a photo database and photo albumprogram came up during September 2003. Having bought a digital cameraa few months ago, the necessity for a program to manage all the takenphotos became urgent.
</p>

<p>
At this time, we did not know about a comparable program for KDE. A few weeks later <em>KimDaBa 1.0</em> was released.We looked into this program but decided to go on with the developmentof <em>KPhotoBook</em> anyway because <em>KimDaBa</em> was not exactlywhat we needed.
</p>

<p>
In February 2004 a first alpha-version of <em>Fotoon</em> was released. <em>Fotoon</em> came closer to what our idea is... butnot exactly. We decide &ndash; once again &ndash; to go on working onKPhotoBook and to have a close eye on these other applications.
</p>

<h1>Evolution of KPhotoBook</h1>
<h2>Version 0.0.3</h2>
<p>Version 0.0.3 was the first release of <em>KPhotoBook</em> and was released in February 2004. It did not provide many features but seemed quite stable already (probably because of the lack of features :-) ). The UI provided a source directory tree and a main window in which thumbnails of the images in the imported directories were shown. There was also a tag tree - it was hard coded at this time. V0.0.3 already had the ability to alter the thumbnail size with a ruler.</p>

<h2>Version 0.0.4</h2>
<p>Version 0.0.4 was released in March 2004. Besides the features of Version 0.0.3, we provided a functional tag tree with title tags and boolean tags, improved filter abilities a few new icons and a new tool bar.</p>

<h1>Why another application to manage photos?</h1>
<p>
It's not easy to manage hundreds or even thousandsof images. Other applications promote themselves to solve thisproblem. They say it'd be easy to manage such a huge amount ofphotos. Having looked at those other applications, we found that itwas not <strong>that</strong> easy and not nearly as straight forward as wethink such an application should be. Beside this, it is also veryimportant that it is not only easy to manage the photos but also tobe fast. Other applications provide the function to tag the picturesbut do not offer this function in a really easy and fast way. Someothers have the same approach as <em>KPhotoBook</em>, but waiting foran application to become usable when no work is done on it is notreally a great thing to do.
