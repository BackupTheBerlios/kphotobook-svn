<td class="newstext">Several changes:
	<ul>
	<li>Updated the <a href="scheduler.html">Scheduler</a> section</li>
	<li>Added a new section on the Scheduler page: "Not Yet Decided" for features which we are not yet sure about if they will be implemented</li>
	<li>Moved the feature list to the "Home" page and removed the "features" page</li>

<td class="newstext">I've just finished a first version containing all basic features (tagging and searching of images). This version is tagged as v_0_0_4.<br/>
The program is still very alpha! The funny thing is, that the application is already rather fast although I did not yet optimize it...<br/>
Please do not yet report wishes for additional features!</td>

<tr><td class="newstext">The homepage has been worked over. The layout of the pages has not changed dramatically - some details here and there. Some information is updated and we have added a whole bunch of new info. Check it out...</td></tr>

<tr><td class="newstext"><a href="http://fotoon.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Fotoon
</a> has been released. We have quickly checked it out. Fotoon is more what we are looking for (compared to <a href="http://ktown.kde.org/kimdaba/" target="_blank">KimDaBa</a>). However, we think it is still very alpha so we decided to go on with our own project.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="newstext">The homepage's built. It's very simple. However, we rather concentrate on the program it is made for. :-)</td></tr>

<tr><td class="newspic" rowspan=2>September 2003<br><img src="pics/kphotobook_h.png"><br>Tom</td><td class="newsheader">KPhotoBook</td></tr>
<tr><td class="newstext">The idea for a photo database and photoalbum program was created in September 2003. We did not know about a compareable program at this time. A few weeks later KimDaBa was released. However, we decided to go on with development anyway because KimDaBa was not exactly what we needed.</td></tr>
