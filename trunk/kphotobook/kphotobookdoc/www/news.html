<tr><td class="newstext"><a href="http://fotoon.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Fotoon
</a> has been released. We have quickly checked it out. Fotoon is more what we are looking for (compared to <a href="http://ktown.kde.org/kimdaba/" target="_blank">KimDaBa</a>). However, we think it is still very alpha so we decided to go on with our own project.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="newstext">KDE 3.2 has been released. It's a great release. We decided to develop KPhotoBook for KDE 3.2 only. It will not run with older KDE versions.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="newstext">The homepage's built. It's very simple. However, we rather concentrate on the program it is made for. :-)</td></tr>

<tr><td class="newstext">The idea for a photo database and photoalbum program was created in September 2003. We did not know about a compareable program at this time. A few weeks later KimDaBa was released. However, we decided to go on with development anyway because KimDaBa was not exactly what we needed.</td></tr>
