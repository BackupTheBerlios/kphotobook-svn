KPhotoBook is an easy to use, intuitive and fast application to manage and organize your photos. The main idea is to be able to annotate your photos with tags (these tags are arranged in a tree) and to refind the photos using the given tags.



Introduction

KPhotoBook is an easy to use, intuitive and fast application to manage and organize your photos. The main idea is to be able to annotate your photos with tags (these tags are arranged in a tree) and to refind the photos using the given tags.

History
-------
The idea for a photo database and photoalbum program was created during September 2003. We did not know about a compareable program for KDE at this time. A few weeks later KimDaBa was released. However, we decided to go on with development anyway because KimDaBa was not exactly what we needed.
In February 2004 a first alpha-version of fotoon was released. Fotoon comes closer to what our idea is... but not exactly. We will go on working on KPhotoBook and have a close eye on these other applications.

differences to the existing projects
------------------------------------
KimDaBa does not provide a tree for arranging the tags. And in my opinion the user interface is not very intuitive. I believe KPhotoBook has the better approach for an intuitive userinterface.
Fotoon uses a similar user interface as I want to implement for KPhotoBook, but the application seems to be very alpha and there wasn't much traffic lately on its cvs. Without wanting to be rude I believe KPhotoBook is more stable than Fotoon and I hope I will make faster progress in implementing it.

features
--------
KPhotoBook will have at least the following features:
- creating a photo database with photos from several folders which can be added single or recursively
- annotate tags to the photos - this can be done for one photo only or for several photos at once
- the tags are arranged in a tree
- there will be different kind of tags: boolean, string, number
- there can be written a description for each file
- searching and filtering the photos using the given tags and description
- all pictures matching the choosen filter are displayed as thumbnails
- the pictures can be rotated (real, exif or database only)
- showing the exif informations of a selected file
- showing the pictures matching the filter in a slide show
- ...

technology/licence
------------------
- KPhotoBook is realized as a KDE 3.2 application
- The database is stored as an XML-file
- KPhotoBook is released under the GPL

current state
-------------
Currently I'm developing with an own cvs-repository. This works very well, but we'd like to make a first version public soon. Since Sourceforge is a great place for OSS-projects we decided to launch our own one there.

At the moment it is possible to:
- add/remove source folders
- filter photos by source folder
- showing/scale thumbnails

A first alpha version will be released in about 2-4 weeks but the homepage will be uploaded earlier.

about me
--------
I'm 26 years old and have studied computer science.
I've been working for 3 years for a big telecommunication company and develop java-applications.
To improve my knowledge about C++ I decided to program a useful application for KDE.

There are two colleagues at work supporting and adwising me. We discuss design and user interface questions together.
And my little brother is helping me writing English texts, designing icons and creating/updating/maintaining the website.
