1) Member Variables are beginning with 'm_'.

2) Setter methods are beginning with 'set'.

3) Getter methods are NOT beginning with 'get'!
    They're named equal the variable but without the 'm_' prefix.

4) Declaring a pointer variable as follow: 'Type* varname'.
    It seems that KDE uses often one of the following formats: 'Type * varname'
    or 'Type *varname' but the format as suggested by me is also used.

5) Storing the data in the engine:

    - Class Image (or File)
        - represents exactly one image or one file ;-).
        - has a list of ImageTagAssoc objects.

    - Class TagNode or its subclasses
        - represents exactly one possible tag (without value).
        - has a list of ImageTagAssoc objects.

    - Class ImageTagAssoc or its subclasses
        - represent the association between one image and one tag.
        - contain the value of the associated tag.
        - there exists one concrete subclass for each TagNode subclass.
